1. IMAGES
All images used in the demo are from Unsplash, a free resource for stock images. While we're allowed to use these images for personal and commercial uses, unfortunately we're not allowed to include them in the template download files. So you will not receive these image files when you purchase a template. 

I know, it sucks. I would have loved to include all images in your purchase. But at the same time, I really don't want to get sued. So we had no choice but to remove them. Hopefully you understand :)

All the HTML and CSS code is there, just like in the demo. All you have to do is find your own images, either from a client or a free stock image site, and place them in the empty <img> tags or 'background-image' css properties.

2. LICENSE
In a perfect world, I would provide these templates for free and allow them to be used in as many projects as you'd like.

While I enjoy making these templates and helping other designers/developers kickstart their projects, they also provide the funds for me to pay my bills and to continue running Webplate. So all I ask is that each purchased template be used for only one commerical project. 

I go into more detail about our licensing agreement here: https://webplate.io/licensing/

Again, hopefully you understand :)

3. THANK YOU
By purchasing this template, you're helping me achieve my goal of helping people and businesses at scale. 
-> I know that providing website templates is a great way to help agencies and other designers/developers speed up their development time. 
-> By speeding up their dev time, they have more time and space to work with more clients. 
-> Working with more clients means they're helping more businesses become better prepared to help solve real-world problems.
-> The more businesses that are helping people solve problems, means that there's more people who are finding solutions to their problems.
-> The more people who find solutions to their real-world problems, the happier the world is!

At least that's the plan. 

You could have purchased a website template from a lot of different places, but you chose to buy one from Webplate. That really means a lot. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.


If you have any questions about this template, or any of our templates, please don't hesitate to reach out.
